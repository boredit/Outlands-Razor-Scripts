# Outlands-Razor-Scripts
This is a small repository of sample scripts for ClassicUO and Razor UOR:CE, as packaged and distributed by UO Outlands.
The scripts all work, though many may not be immediately useful as they were created to demonstrate how one could achieve a goal using the new Razor the language described in the Razor Scripting Guide.

I have no affiliation with the above projects and wish to thank the dedicated development community that provides these great tools for our 25 year old wizard game! Thank you!
